# Play with maps

Heavily cribbed from: https://rsnous.com/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/

Place papers for "geokit" and "geokit: contains" to support displaying maps. Place the "blank" paper and point to it with a "map search" paper. Finally, point a "keyboard" paper at the map search. Now you can type a place name and it will show up on the blank paper.
